Question 1: The class that is used to implement the conroller pattern in this library is the SnappingSheetController Widget. The features that allow to the developer to control are: snappingPositions, the snapping positions were the sheet can snap to, and there is a method called snapToPosition, by it we can change the position of the snap sheet

Question 2: The parameter that controls the described behavior is the snappingPositions Property which is a list that contains the different snapping positions of the SheetBelow.

Question 3: InkWell and GestureDetector have common attributes but they are different. An advantage of GestureDetector over InkWell is that: GestureDetector class is very broad. you can detect every type of interaction the user has with the screen or widget using it. it includes pinch, swipe, touch, plus custom gestures. provides more controls like dragging etc. InkWell has a limited number of gestures to detect An advantage of InkWell over GestureDetector is that: InkWell include ripple effect tap and other ink related features, which GestureDetector doesn't has.
